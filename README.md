I'll probably be experimenting with adding images to my layouts in this repo
Here's a couple of examples I'm going to be considering as inspiration for this project:
  - https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/rvQmxQ
  - https://codepen.io/julesforrest/full/yowMPw/
  - https://codepen.io/semblance/full/XexVbB

Maybe I'll go sort of "misc world travely" type stuff

... Hmmm.. on second thought, maybe I'll just make each of these projects about a different
country. I think that's a good idea, that'll make projects easier to figure out in the future
